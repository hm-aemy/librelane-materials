# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
This documentation project is **community-driven**: created by the community, for the community.  
Our goal is to provide a **clear, structured, and accessible overview** of IC design flows (digital, analog, and mixed-signal) using open-source tools.  

## Contribution Philosophy

This documentation is **not a textbook**.  
We keep explanations **clear and concise**, and for details we rely on **external open-access resources**.  

Whenever you feel something should be explained in depth, you have three ways to do it:

1. **See Also blocks (`{seealso}`)**  
   - Point to related material or tutorials.  
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ```{seealso}
     For practical examples of timing constraints, see  
     [ASIC World – RTL Design](https://asic-world.com/).
     ```

2. **Inline links**  
   - Add links to keywords or concepts directly in the text.  
   - Example:  
     “Standard cells are defined in a [Liberty file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_file).”

3. **Further Reading section**  
   - At the end of each page, include a curated list of external resources.  
   - Example:
     ```markdown

     ```

## Ways You Can Contribute

- **Add a new concept**  
  - Create a new file in the proper section (`concepts/`, `digital_flows/`, `analog_flows/`, `mixed_signal/`, or `tutorials/`).  
  - Add the new page to the main `index.md` through the `{toctree}` directive.  
  - Keep explanations high-level, and use links for detailed content.  

- **Improve existing content**  
  - Add **See Also**, **Inline links**, or **Further Reading** to strengthen learning paths.  
  - Improve explanations while keeping them short and clear.  

- **Fixes and clarifications**  
  - Correct typos, grammar, or formatting.  
  - Ensure consistency in style and structure.  

## General Structure of a Section

Each page should follow this pattern:

1. **Title** (`#`)  
2. **Short Introduction** — 3–5 sentences explaining the concept.  
3. **Subsections** (if needed) — break down into smaller topics.  
4. **Notes / See Also** — highlight key points or link to related docs.  
5. **Further Reading** — always close with curated external resources.  


## Style Guidelines

- Use **Markdown with MyST** (`.md` files).  
- Use clear English, simple sentences, and avoid jargon when possible.  
- Prefer **active voice**: “This tool generates a netlist” instead of “A netlist is generated by this tool.”  
- Always add a **Further Reading** section at the bottom of each page.
