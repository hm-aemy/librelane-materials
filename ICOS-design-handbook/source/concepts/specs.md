# Specifications and Requirements

Designing an integrated circuit (IC) always begins with a **set of specifications**.  
These specifications describe *what the circuit must achieve* in terms of functionality, performance, power, and physical constraints.  
They are the foundation of the entire design flow, guiding decisions from the first schematic to the final layout (GDSII).

## Why specifications matter

- 📌 They define the **design goals** before any line of RTL code or schematic is drawn.  
- 📌 They serve as a **contract** between system architects, designers, and verification engineers.  
- 📌 They allow **objective evaluation** of the final IC: pass/fail is decided based on the specs.

## Typical specifications in digital design

- **Clock frequency / timing**: maximum operating frequency, setup and hold margins.  
- **Area**: maximum silicon footprint allowed.  
- **Power consumption**: dynamic and leakage power budgets.  
- **I/O and interfaces**: voltage levels, supported protocols (UART, SPI, I²C, etc.).  
- **Reliability**: operating temperature, ESD protection, lifetime targets.

## Typical specifications in analog design

- **Gain and bandwidth**: small-signal gain, unity-gain frequency.  
- **Noise**: thermal, flicker, or integrated noise requirements.  
- **Linearity**: Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Intermodulation Distortion (IMD).  
- **PSRR and CMRR**: power supply rejection and common-mode rejection.  
- **Accuracy**: offset voltage, bias currents, reference stability.  
- **Output swing / headroom**: limits set by technology and supply voltage.

## From specs to constraints

In practice, specifications are **translated into constraints** used by tools and designers:

- Digital flows → timing constraints (SDC files), power targets, floorplan area.  
- Analog flows → bias conditions, device sizing rules, performance corners.  

These constraints ensure that the automated flow (synthesis, place & route, simulation) is always evaluated against the original design goals.

## Key takeaway

Specifications are not optional: they are the **starting point and the final checkpoint** of any IC design.  
Well-defined specs make the difference between a successful tapeout and endless iterations.
