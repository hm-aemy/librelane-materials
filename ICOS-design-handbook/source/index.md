# Welcome to the IC Design Guide

**A community-driven documentation for learning and teaching integrated circuit design.**

This project is an **open documentation created by the community, for the community**, with the goal of providing a clear and practical guide to the complete flow of integrated circuit (IC) design.  
It is intended for **professors, students, and designers** who want to explore the process of going from **specifications and simulation** all the way to a **final GDSII layout**.
