# Learning Objectives

This section defines the main objectives and expected outcomes of the *Teach-the-Teacher* program for open-source digital IC design.  
The program follows a [Problem-Based Learning (PBL) method](https://mediapool.hm.edu/mediapool/media/dachmarke/dm_lokal/bologna/hd_mint/veroeffentlichungen_3/Wolf_et_al_HDMINT_2013.pdf) approach, where participants learn by solving realistic design challenges rather than following step-by-step procedures.

## Overall Learning Objectives

By the end of this program, participants (teachers) will be able to:

1. **Explain** the complete digital design flow from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.  
2. **Demonstrate** synthesis, floorplanning, placement, and routing using Yosys, OpenROAD, or LibreLane.  
3. **Guide** students in developing, simulating, and validating digital designs using Verilator, GTKWave, and Ngspice.  
4. **Interpret** verification reports (DRC, LVS, STA) and explain their significance in the tape-out process.  
5. **Apply** a **problem-based learning methodology**, creating learning experiences centered on real design problems.  
6. **Promote** open-source design practices, licensing awareness, and community contribution.  

## Learning Outcomes

The following outcomes are grouped by three complementary dimensions: Conceptual, Practical, and Pedagogical. Each aligns with the stages of the design flow and the problem-based learning process.

### Conceptual Outcomes
- Explain the stages and interdependencies of the digital design flow (RTL → GDSII).  
- Describe the goals of {doc}`synthesis <../concepts/synthesis>`, {doc}`placement <../concepts/placement>`, {doc}`routing <../concepts/routing>`, and {doc}`verification <../concepts/verification>` in relation to manufacturability.  
- Identify common design challenges and analyze them from a problem-solving perspective.  
- Relate analog and mixed-signal extensions to the same design and verification principles.  

### Practical Outcomes
- Install and configure **open-source design environments** (Linux, Docker, or Nix).  
- Simulate Verilog designs using **Verilator** or **Icarus Verilog**.  
- Perform **logic synthesis** using **Yosys** and interpret synthesis reports.  
- Implement **physical design** using **OpenROAD** or **LibreLane**, including placement, routing, and timing analysis.  
- Run **DRC/LVS** checks in **Magic** or **KLayout** and interpret verification results.  
- Document and present the complete design flow as a reproducible process.  

### Pedagogical Outcomes
- Design **problem-based modules** that connect design challenges with conceptual understanding.  
- Guide students through **independent exploration**, simulation, and debugging processes.  
- Encourage **collaboration and reflection**, helping students articulate how they solved each problem.  
- Assess both the **design outcome** and the **problem-solving process** (analysis, research, testing, reflection).  
- Connect students with **community resources**, open documentation, and collaborative design ecosystems.

> *These learning objectives emphasize not only technical proficiency but also the ability to teach through exploration, reflection, and authentic engineering problems.*
