# Teach-the-Teacher: Open-Source Digital IC Design

This chapter is designed to help educators and instructors teach digital IC design using open-source tools and PDKs. It builds on the concepts and flows presented in this handbook, transforming them into a structured learning experience for instructors who wish to train students, researchers, or engineers in reproducible design practices.

The objective is to create reproducible and adaptable educational modules that enable instructors to:
- Teach RTL-to-GDSII design using open-source tools and PDKs.  
- Combine theoretical foundations with hands-on experimentation.  
- Foster a collaborative learning environment around open hardware.

## Teaching methodology

The educational approach adopted in this material is primarily based on the [Problem-Based Learning (PBL) method](https://mediapool.hm.edu/mediapool/media/dachmarke/dm_lokal/bologna/hd_mint/veroeffentlichungen_3/Wolf_et_al_HDMINT_2013.pdf). Learners are presented with realistic design challenges — such as synthesizing, simulating, and verifying a digital block — and guided to solve them using open-source EDA tools.

This approach emphasizes:
- **Active learning** through exploration and problem-solving.  
- **Contextual understanding** by connecting theory with practice.  
- **Collaboration and peer discussion**, simulating real design environments.

> *While this handbook has been designed around PBL principles, the material can be adapted to other teaching styles.* Future versions are expected to include alternative structures aligned with other teaching methodologies, allowing institutions to integrate this content according to their specific pedagogical strategies.

## Purpose of this chapter

- Provide instructors with clear {doc}`learning_objectives` and {doc}`course_structure`.  
- Offer {doc}`suggested_problems` that can be adapted to different audiences.  
- Define {doc}`assessment_guidelines` that focus on understanding and problem-solving rather than rote tool execution.  
- Build a growing community of educators contributing to open hardware education.

## Structure

This chapter contains the following sections:

1. {doc}`learning_objectives` — defines conceptual, technical, and pedagogical goals.  
2. {doc}`course_structure` — 
3. {doc}`suggested_problems` — hands-on modules aligned with the main design flow.  
4. {doc}`assessment_guidelines` — evaluation rubrics and teaching strategies.  
5. {doc}`resources` — open references, courses, and communities.  

Each section is designed to connect directly with the conceptual and flow chapters in this handbook.
