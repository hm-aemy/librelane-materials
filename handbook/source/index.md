# Welcome to the IC Design Guide

**A community-driven documentation for learning and teaching integrated circuit design.**

This project is an **open documentation created by the community, for the community**, with the goal of providing a clear and practical guide to the complete flow of integrated circuit (IC) design.  
It is intended for **professors, students, and designers** who want to explore the process of going from **specifications and simulation** all the way to a **final GDSII layout**.

## What you will find here

- **Theory and context** — fundamental concepts of digital, analog, and mixed-signal IC design.  
- **Step-by-step tutorials** — practical examples using open-source tools.  
- **Design flows** — from schematic capture and simulation to layout, verification, and GDS export.  
- **Educational material** — content oriented to teaching and classroom use.  
- **Community contributions** — shared knowledge, tips, and best practices collected from experience.
